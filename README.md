# How to install Dark Theme UI Texture Pack guide

2. Download Texture Pack (You can do that by clicking on "Code" button and "Download ZIP").
3. Unpack ZIP file you downloaded. (You might need to download extraction tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip)
4. Open extracted file and copy the content of the folder into your /World of Warcraft/retail/Interface file. !Its not an AddOn so dont copy it into AddOn folder!

Your "Interface" folder after installation should look like this:
